# Pixelizer
A python script that can convert an image into a pixelized version


I don't know, don't expect anything out of this, legal wise, I'm not responsible for, blah blah blah. Theres no error catching or anything, and you have to type in the paramters yourself. I'll add docs for the variables later. The script isn't that long or complicated, you could probably figure it out.
